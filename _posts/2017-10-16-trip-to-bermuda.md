Where has the summer gone?
This may be a slightly depressing blog post for reader and writer alike. As its about our summer holiday to Bermuda and New York. Looking back we had a fantastic holiday staying at two very different destinations.

## Bermuda
Our first stop was Bermauda staying with friends for 9 nights. Kyle had been on many occasions before and talked about it so much I felt I had been. After flying 10hrs we arrived feeling fresh and ready to attack the day as we flew first class, with British Airways. What an amazing flying and dining experience.

From the outset Bermuda was truly **breathe taking**, high temperatures, and the beaches with its pink sand and exceptionally clear water. Topped off with being hosted by wonderful friends. 
Initially I didn't think there would be much to do in Bermuda but I was proved wrong. Firstly the America’s Cup was on while we where there, what an experience to see ……… Racing.  So many beautiful bays to relax on a lounger basking the high temperatures eating chilled fruit and salty crisps.

So many wonderful things to do and experience in Bermuada I couldn't write about them all. If you ever have the opportunity to visit this beautiful island ( I will be very jealous)  you will then understand what I mean.
After spending 10 days in Bermuda (one extra night, as our flight was cancelled ) we then flew onto New York, I will get round to writing about it soon, stay tuned.
