Welcome to Pear Tree Lane, and my foray into the world of blogging!  I hope to share some of my day to day life with you, and all the things which I love.
My name is Emma and I'm married to the lovely Kyle and he accomplished something quite incredible getting a Co. Antrim girl like me to move to Co. Down. From a young age, I have been passionate about ‘things looking pretty’ along with antique furniture. Needless to say I had quite a large ‘bottom drawer’ before I even got engaged. Kyle and I were definitely  born in the wrong era as we both love older pieces of furniture with lots of character.
I am excited to bring you all along with me on my blogging adventures out and about, bringing you inside our first home.  Along with keeping you up to date with my wardrobe and the various restaurants we love to visit. All Thanks to Louise at The Vintage Room, for encouraging me to step out into the world of blogging along with my wonderful husband for building my bespoke blog. ‘I just find myself happy with the simple things. Appreciating the blessings God gives me’
